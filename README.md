Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
->Software engineering is the systematic application 
of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of 
high-quality software systems.
Importance of software engineering include:
->Enables creation of efficient software application to improve communication, medical sector and transport

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestone 1: Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)

->Introduced concepts of modularity, control flow, and data structures. This Improved code readability, maintainability, and reliability.

Milestone 2: Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)

->Shifted focus from functions to objects, enabling encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This Promoted code reuse, reduced complexity, and fostered software design patterns.

Milestone 3: Agile Software Development (1990s-2000s)

-> Emphasized iterative development, continuous testing, and collaboration among teams. this accelerated development cycles, improved responsiveness to changing requirements, and fostered customer involvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-> Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
 -> Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user 
interface.
 -> Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design 
specifications.
 -> Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and 
functional requirements.
 -> Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 -> Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after 
deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
->Agile represents an Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and 
responding to change while Waterfall represents a Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, 
implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
->Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
->Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test 
plans.
->Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
->Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): This provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, 
IntelliJ IDEA).
->Version Control Systems (VCS): This are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and 
coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-> Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
->Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
->Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
->Unit testing : It a level of the software testing process where individual units/components of a software/system are tested.
=>The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.

->Integration testing : It is a level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group. 
=>The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.
->System testing : It is a level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested. 
=>The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.
->Acceptance testing : It is a level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. 
=>The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
->Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
->Vague: Explain Software engineering
->Improved:
=>As a unviversity student, explain to an examiner the meaning of software engineering and its importance to humanity today.
in the improved part, i specified the level of explanation and who is supposed to consume the results.
